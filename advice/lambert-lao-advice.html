                <h4>Stay Consistent!</h4>
                <p>Try to devote a period of time every day to learning. It can be as little as 20 minutes a day, or 2 hours a day 
                    but the key is to be consistent with your coding so that you form positive habits. You can also hold yourself accountable
                    by learning in public through platforms like twitter.
